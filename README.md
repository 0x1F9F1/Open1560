Open1560 is an open source re-implementation of Midtown Madness Sneak Preview Beta / Build 1560.

This project is a bottom-up rewrite of Midtown Madness 1, using the original binary to provide functions that have not been implemented yet.<br/>
The intention is to allow the fixing of bugs, implementation of new features and porting to platforms unsupported by the original.<br/>
